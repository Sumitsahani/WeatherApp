# Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App is a simple web application built using **ReactJS** that allows users to check the current weather and a 3-day weather forecast for a selected city. The app uses **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch the weather data and ensures a smooth user experience with data persistence using **localStorage**.

## Features
- **City Selection**: Choose from the following cities:
  - Ho Chi Minh
  - Singapore
  - Kuala Lumpur
  - Tokyo
  - Athens
- **Weather Data**: Displays the current weather including temperature and weather condition for the selected city.
- **3-Day Weather Forecast**: Displays the weather forecast for the next three days.
- **Persistent City Selection**: The selected city is saved in the browserâ€™s local storage to persist even after a page refresh.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: The app works on all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 and above.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API (Version 2.5)
- **Additional Libraries**: None (Axios is not used, `fetch` with async/await is used instead)

## API Integration
- **OpenWeatherMap API** is used to fetch weather data for the selected city.
  - Current weather:  
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric`
  - 3-day forecast:  
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric`
  
You need to replace `{API_KEY}` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get it by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
